# Microsoft_Face_API_Helper_Library_JavaScript
A library that allows you to easily interact with Microsoft's Face API via JavaScript




A sample use case goes something like this:
1. Config variables are populated
2. Group is created //createGroup()
3. Person is created in that group //uploadFace()
4. An image of the person is stored publicly so that anyone with the URL can access it //how you do this is up to you. You can send the image to your server and store it there.
5. Using the person's ID that was generated when you created them, upload the image to their profile using uploadFace(). //NOTE: the imageURL variable must be populated with the URL that points to your public facing image
6. Create another public facing image or provide a URL to an existing image and run detectFace()
7. Use identifyFace(), which utilizes the faceId generated by detectFace() and sends it to getPerson(), to get the person's name
