# Microsoft_Face_API_Helper_Library_JavaScript
A library that allows you to easily interact with Microsoft's Face API via JavaScript




A sample usage of this goes something like this:
> Config variables are populated
> Group is created //createGroup()
> Person is created in that group //uploadFace()
> An image of the person is stored publicly so that anyone with the URL can access it //how you do this is up to you. You can send the image to your server and store it there.
> Using the person's ID that was generated when you created them, upload the image to their profile using uploadFace(). //NOTE: the imageURL variable must be populated with the URL that points to your public facing image
> Create another public facing image or provide a URL to an existing image and run detectFace()
> Use identifyFace(), which utilizes the faceId generated by detectFace() and sends it to getPerson(), to get the person's name
